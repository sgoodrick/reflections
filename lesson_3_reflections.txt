When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For backing up files, to share with others, to work between multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not be working on the same aspects of the project as  what is getting updated on the remote site.
